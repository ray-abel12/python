#A nursery rhyme: As I was going to St. Ives, I met a man with seven wives. Every wife had
#sacks, and wives, how many were going to St. Ives? There are interesting aspects to this
#puzzle, such as who is actually going to St. Ives. For our purposes, assume that everyone
#and everything is headed to St. Ives. Write a program to calculate that total.
me = 1
him = 1
wifes = 7
sacks = 7
cats = 7
kitten = 7
total_sum = me + him + wifes + sacks + cats + kitten
print(f"the total number of every one and thing going to st .ives are {total_sum}")
